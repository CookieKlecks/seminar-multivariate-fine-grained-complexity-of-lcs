\subsubsection{Large LCS}

We now assume that $\alpha_L = \alpha_m$, i.e., $L = \Theta(m)$.
This means that our constructed instances should match almost the full smaller string $y$ in an \lcs{}.
In the previous construction there were large unmatched parts, hence, this construction will not work in this case.
However, we will still use the \emph{normalized vector gadgets} from the previous construction, but we will change how we are embedding them into a full string.
Therefore, the authors created a so called \emph{1vs1/2vs1 gadget} \cite[section 9.2.1]{Bringman.2018}.
We will present this gadget in the following.

\paragraph{1vs1/2vs1 gadget}
The idea is to have two sets of strings $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_P$ and $y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_Q$ embedded into $x$ and $y$.
This is done in such a way, that in an \lcs{} each gadget for $y_i$ is either matched with one or two gadgets from $x$.
In the former case the \lcs{} will only depend on the \lcs{} of the underlying string pairs and in the latter case, the full gadget for $y_i$ will be matched.
To formalize this, the authors presented the following lemma \cite[Lemma 9.6]{Bringman.2018}.

\begin{lemma}[see ]
For $P$, $Q$ and $0 \leq N \leq Q$ with $P = 2Q - N$ and strings $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_P$ of length $\ell_x$ and $y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_Q$ of length $\ell_y$, construct
\begin{align*}
	x &:= \gLargeLCS{x_1}\gLargeLCS{x_2} \cdots \gLargeLCS{x_P}\\
	y &:= \gLargeLCS{y_1}\gLargeLCS{y_2} \cdots \gLargeLCS{y_Q}
\end{align*}
where $\gLargeLCS{w} = 0^{\gamma_1}1^{\gamma_2}(01)^{\gamma_3}w1^{\gamma_3}$ with $\gamma_3 = \ell_x + \ell_y$, $\gamma_2 = 8\gamma_3$ and $\gamma_1 = 6\gamma_2$. \todo{is the citing sufficient as it is basically a direct cite of the paper?}
It holds:

\[
L(x,y) = Q(\gamma_1 + \gamma_2 + 3\gamma_3) + (Q - N)\ell_y + \max_{I \in \binom{[Q]}{N}} \sum_{i \in I} L(x_i, y_i)
\]
\end{lemma}

Intuitively the three summands can be interpreted as follows.
The first term is the sum of all guarding strings that can always be matched.
The second term is for the gadgets for $y_i$ that fully match with two $x$-Gadgets.
The third term represents the direct matching.


\begin{proof}
Note that to show (\ref{lemma:1v1gadget:1}) it suffices to show that $L(\gLargeLCS{x_i}\gLargeLCS{x_{i+1}}, \gLargeLCS{y_j}) = |y_j|$.

\end{proof}




\begin{lemma}
Let $\rho_0 > \rho_1$ and $P, Q \geq 1$ with $P = 2Q - N$ where $0 \leq N \leq Q$.
For any strings $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_P$ of length $\ell_x$ and $y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_Q$ of length $\ell_y$ with $L(x_i, y_j) \in \{\rho_0, \rho_1\}$ for all pairs of strings $x_i$ and $y_j$, construct
\begin{align*}
	x &:= \gLargeLCS{x_1}\gLargeLCS{x_2} \cdots \gLargeLCS{x_P}\\
	y &:= \gLargeLCS{y_1}\gLargeLCS{y_2} \cdots \gLargeLCS{y_Q}
\end{align*}
where $\gLargeLCS{w} = 0^{\gamma_1}1^{\gamma_2}(01)^{\gamma_3}w1^{\gamma_3}$ with $\gamma_3 = \ell_x + \ell_y$, $\gamma_2 = 8\gamma_3$ and $\gamma_1 = 6\gamma_2$.
It holds:

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item $L(x,y) \geq Q\Gamma + (Q-N)\ell_y + N\rho_1$
\item $L(x,y) \geq Q\Gamma + (Q-N)\ell_y + (N-1)\rho_1 + \rho_0$ if and only if there are $j \in \indexSet{Q}$ and $\lambda \in \indexSet{N}$ s.t. $L(x_{2j-\lambda}, y_j) = \rho_0$
\end{enumerate}
%
where $\Gamma := \gamma_1 + \gamma_2 + 3\gamma_3$.

\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We first show that for $N=0$ it holds that $L(x,y) = |y| = Q\gamma + Q\ell_y$

\end{proof}
