\section{Define Parameters}
\label{sec:def-params}
To properly scope the analysis it is necessary to define the parameters that are being analyzed.
Here the most studied parameters for \lcs{} are included in the analysis \cite{Bergroth.2000,Paterson.1994}. 
These are the input size $n$ of the longer and $m$ of the shorter string, 
the length $L$ of an \lcs{},
the size $|\Sigma|$ of the underlying alphabet,
the number $\Delta$ of deletions in the larger and $\delta$ of deletions in the shorter string.
Further the number of matching pairs $M$ and dominant pairs $d$ are included.
See \autoref{tab:parameter_definitions} for a formal definition and description of each parameter.
%
%Note, that we always assume $x$ to be the longer string. Otherwise we could just swap $x$ and $y$.
We will use the notation $p(x,y)$ to refer to the value of the parameter $p$ for the strings $x$ and $y$.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{p{6.5cm}p{6.5cm}}
\toprule
\textbf{Parameter and Definition} & \textbf{Description} \\
\midrule
$n(x,y) := |x|$ & Length of the longer string. \\
$m(x,y) := |y|$ & Length of the shorter string. \\
$L(x,y) := |\text{LCS}(x,y)|$ & Length of a longest common subsequence. \\
$\Sigma(x,y) := |\Sigma|$ & Size of the shared alphabet $\Sigma$ of the input strings. \\
$\Delta(x,y) := |x| - L(x,y)$ & Number of deletions in the longer string. \\
$\delta(x,y) := |y| - L(x,y)$ & Number of deletions in the shorter string. \\
$M(x,y) := \#\{(i,j) \mid x[i] = y[j]\}$ & Number of matching pairs. They count the number of possible candidates in an \lcs{}. \\
$d(x,y) := \#\{(i,j) \mid\;L[i,j] > L[i-1,j] \text{ and }$\newline 
$\phantom{d(x,y) := \#\{(i,j) \mid\;}\; L[i,j] > L[i,j-1]\}$ & Number of dominant pairs. These are the matching pairs $(i,j)$ where $L(x[1..i],y[1..j])$ increases, i.e., an even more refined number of \lcs{} candidates. \\
