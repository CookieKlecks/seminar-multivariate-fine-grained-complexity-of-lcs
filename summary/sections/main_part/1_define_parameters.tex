\section{Define Parameters}
\label{sec:def-params}
To properly scope the multivariate analysis it is necessary to define the parameters of the problem that are being analyzed.
Here in the case of the \lcs{} problem, the most studied parameters in this field are included in the analysis (see \cite{Bergroth.2000}, \cite{Paterson.1994}). 
These are the input size $n$ of the longer and $m$ of the shorter string, 
the length $L$ of a longest common subsequence,
the size $|\Sigma|$ of the underlying alphabet,
the number $\Delta$ of deletions in the larger and $\delta$ of deletions in the shorter string.
Further the two similarity measures number of matching pairs $M$ and dominant pairs $d$ are included.



Note, that we always assume $x$ to be the longer string. Otherwise we could just swap $x$ and $y$.\todo{Add Motivation matching pairs and dominant pairs}
We will use the notation $p(x,y)$ to refer to the value of the parameter $p$ for the strings $x$ and $y$.
