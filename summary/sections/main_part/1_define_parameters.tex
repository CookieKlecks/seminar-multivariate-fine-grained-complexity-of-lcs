\section{Define Parameters}
To properly scope the multivariate analysis it is necessary to define the parameters of the problem that are being analyzed.
Here in the case of the \lcs{} problem, the most studied parameters are included in the analysis (see \cite{Bergroth.2000}, \cite{Paterson.1994}). 
These are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item the input size $n = |x|$ of the longer string and $m = |y|$ of the shorter string
	\item the length $L$ of a longest subsequence
	\item the size $|\Sigma|$ of the underlying alphabet used for $x$ and $y$
	\item the number $\Delta = n - L$ of deletions in the smaller and $\delta = m - L$ of deletions in the shorter string
	\item the number of matching pairs $M$ and dominant pairs $d$
\end{itemize}
Note, that we always assume $x$ to be the longer string. Otherwise we could just swap $x$ and $y$.\todo{Add Motivation matching pairs and dominant pairs}
We will use the notation $p(x,y)$ for a parameter $p$ to refer to the value of this parameter for the strings $x$ and $y$.
