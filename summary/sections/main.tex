\section{Multivariate Analysis of \lcs}
Apart from the actual results in the form of conditional lower bounds for \lcs{}, the paper also offers a general approach on how to tackle multivariate fine-grained complexity analysis.
They show that this task can be split into the following three steps:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Define Parameters
	\item Find Parameter Relations
	\item Find Reductions
\end{enumerate}
Step one properly scopes the analysis by specifying the interesting parameters.
The second step then bounds the parameter space by showing which parameter combinations are actually valid and non-trivial.
In the last step the actual reductions are presented.
Here it is important that the constructed instances span the full parameter space.
The upcoming summary is structured according to these steps to show the general approach with \lcs{} as example.
%\todo{I have the feeling that I couldn't mention the general approach enough due to size constraints. Should I rather completely remove it?}
